# Half-Life for SDSG

A fully set-up, browser-playable version of *Half-Life* running on a WebAssembly port of the GoldSource engine.

This repo is **already configured** so users can just open the site and play. No asset copying. No local setup. No technical babysitting.

## What This Is

This project hosts *Half-Life* running directly in the browser using:
- WebAssembly (wasm)
- JavaScript
- A web-ported GoldSource/Xash engine

The website is preconfigured so players **do not need to install or move files manually**.

## What Users Do

They:
- Open the website  
- Click play  
- Play Half-Life in their browser  

That’s it. No downloads. No setup rituals.

## Features

- Fully browser-based Half-Life
- Engine compiled for the web
- Preconfigured filesystem and assets
- Works on modern browsers with WebAssembly support
- Designed for SDSG deployment/use

## Technical Notes (For Nerds)

- Uses a WebAssembly build of the GoldSource/Xash engine
- JavaScript handles input, filesystem, and runtime glue
- Includes engine scripts, UI, and supporting files
- Runs entirely client-side once loaded

You do **not** need:
- Steam
- A local server
- Manual asset copying
- Native executables

## Browser Support

- Chrome / Chromium-based browsers
- Firefox
- Edge

If your browser can’t run this, it’s not the repo’s fault — it’s your browser’s.
